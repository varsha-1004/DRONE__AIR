1. camera is stable because of loiter mode of drone.
2. we are able to estimate the GPS location of the object center point
3. camera is parallel to the ground
4. object is detected correctly with its bounding boxes in each frame
5. the height/length ratio and height/width ratio remains constant
6. we are able to do mobilnet object detection using python2
7. we are able to stream the camera and then distribute it in two parts: live stream and controller
8. live stream takes image input at 60hz and is able to display it without latency
9. object detection is performed easily by resizing the camera input image from 320x240 to 300x300

i'm taking camera input from a drone, performing object detection on the image frame so that i can find my landing point, then i'm finding the distance from the center of the frame to the object detection coordinates, now i'm finding the real distance from me to the object, then i need to find the gps coordinates of the object present so that i can hover on top of it ,so my queston is how do i find the gps coordinates, i'm using pixhawk as my flight controller and jetson nano to perform these taska

Thank you for providing the additional context. Based on the information you've shared, it seems you're performing object detection using a camera mounted on a drone to find your landing point. Once you've detected an object and determined its distance from the center of the camera frame, you're calculating the real distance from the drone to the object. Now, you want to find the GPS coordinates of the object so that you can hover over it.

To find the GPS coordinates of the object detected by your drone's camera, you can follow these steps:

    Coordinate Transformation: Since you know the distance from the drone to the object and the direction in which the object is present relative to the drone's heading, you can use trigonometry to calculate the lateral displacement (east-west) and longitudinal displacement (north-south) of the object from the drone's current GPS coordinates.

    GPS Coordinates Calculation: Once you have the lateral and longitudinal displacements, you can add them to the drone's current GPS coordinates to find the GPS coordinates of the object.

    Implementation: You'll need to implement these calculations in your software, which is running on the Jetson Nano. Ensure that you have access to the drone's current GPS coordinates, heading, and altitude. Additionally, make sure that the camera's orientation relative to the drone's direction of flight is calibrated accurately.

    Integration with Pixhawk: Once you've calculated the GPS coordinates of the object, you can send this information to the Pixhawk flight controller. Pixhawk supports MAVLink communication protocol, so you can use MAVLink messages to send the GPS coordinates to the flight controller. This will allow the drone to adjust its position and hover over the detected object.

    Testing and Calibration: It's crucial to thoroughly test your system in a controlled environment before deploying it in real-world scenarios. Ensure that the object detection, distance calculation, and GPS coordinate calculation are accurate and reliable. Calibrate your system as needed to improve accuracy.

By following these steps and integrating the necessary calculations into your software, you should be able to find the GPS coordinates of the object detected by your drone's camera and hover over it using your Pixhawk flight controller.
can you tell me the gps coordinates calculation

Certainly! To calculate the GPS coordinates of the object detected by your drone's camera, you'll need to perform a coordinate transformation based on the drone's current GPS coordinates, its heading (direction), and the distance and direction of the object relative to the drone. Here's how you can do it:

    Convert Heading to Bearing: First, convert the drone's heading (in degrees, where 0° is North, 90° is East, 180° is South, and 270° is West) to a bearing angle (in radians, where 0 radians is North, π/2 radians is East, π radians is South, and 3π/2 radians is West).

    Bearing (θ) = π/2 - Heading * π/180

    Calculate Lateral and Longitudinal Displacements: Use trigonometry to calculate the lateral (east-west) and longitudinal (north-south) displacements of the object relative to the drone's current position.

    Lateral Displacement (dEast) = Distance * sin(Bearing)

    Longitudinal Displacement (dNorth) = Distance * cos(Bearing)

    Convert Displacements to GPS Coordinates: Add the calculated displacements to the drone's current GPS coordinates to find the GPS coordinates of the object.

    Object Latitude = Drone Latitude + (dNorth / (111111 meters per degree latitude))

    Object Longitude = Drone Longitude + (dEast / (111111 meters per degree longitude * cos(Drone Latitude)))

    Note: 111111 meters per degree latitude is an approximation of the distance per degree of latitude at the equator. The value varies slightly depending on the latitude, but this approximation is commonly used for small-scale calculations.

    Adjust Altitude (Optional): If needed, you can also adjust the altitude of the object based on the drone's altitude relative to the ground.

These calculations will give you the GPS coordinates of the object detected by your drone's camera, allowing you to hover over it using your Pixhawk flight controller. Make sure to handle units correctly (e.g., radians for angles, meters for distances) and consider any necessary adjustments for accuracy based on your specific setup and environment.
